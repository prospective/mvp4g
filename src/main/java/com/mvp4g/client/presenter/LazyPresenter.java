/**
 * Special type of presenter that will be built only when it handles its first event. To do so, the
 * bind method (that is called only the first time a presenter needs to handle an event) is divided
 * in two:
 * <ul>
 * <li>createPresenter: method where presenter should be built (ie all its attributes should be
 * instantiated). By default, it does nothing.</li>
 * <li>bindView: method where required bindings between this Presenter and its View should be done.
 * By default it does nothing.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A <code>LazyPresenter</code> can only have a view which type is compatible with
 * <code>LazyView</code>. This type of presenter will automatically call the createView method of
 * the <code>LazyView</code> when its bind method is called.
 *
 * @param <V> Type of the view injected into the presenter. Must extends <code>LazyView</code>.
 * @param <E> Type of the event bus used by the presenter.

/**
 * This annotation can be used to annotate the method of an event in your EventBus interface. It
 * indicates which event should be fired when a child module is done loading and its start view
 * needs to be displayed.<br>
 * <br>
 * The event is fired with the child module start view so the event's method should have one
 * parameter which type is compatible with the module start view.<br>
 * <br>
 * The same event can be used to display one to several child module start view. To set the child
 * modules the event should handle, you need to add their class of the annotation attribute.

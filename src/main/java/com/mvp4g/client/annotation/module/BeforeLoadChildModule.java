/**
 * This annotation can be used to annotate the method of an event in your EventBus interface. It
 * indicates which event should be fired before a child module is loading in case the code of a
 * child module is loaded thanks to GWT2 Code Splitting feature.<br>
 * <br>
 * You can use this annotation for example to show a wait popup.<br>
 * <br>
 * You can only annotate methods with no parameter (ie only event with no object associated can be
 * used).<br>
 * <br>
 * You must not have more than one <code>BeforeLoadChildModule</code> annotation in a class.

/**
 * This annotation is used on methods to indicate that this method must be used to inject a service.<br>
 * <br>
 * This annotation must be used only in classes that have a <code>Presenter</code> or
 * <code>History</code> annotation.<br>
 * <br>
 * When a service needs to be injected, the framework will search an instance of a service with the
 * same class. If it doesn't found one, it will create one.<br>
 * This means that only one instance of each service class will be created.<br>
 * <br>
 * You can also specify to inject a particular instance of a service thanks to its name with the
 * attribute <i>serviceName</i>.<br>
 *
 * @author plcoirier
 * @deprecated As of release 1.2.0, shoud use GIN injection
